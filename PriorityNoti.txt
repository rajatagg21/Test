Good — now we are designing a **globally exhaustive, mutually exclusive, domain-agnostic priority taxonomy**.

The constraint is strong:

* No personalization
* Works across countries
* Covers finance, health, travel, enterprise, social, IoT, government, etc.
* No blind spots
* Exactly one class per notification

So we must think systematically.

---

# Step 1: Enumerate All Global Notification Domains

A global smartphone user can receive notifications from:

1. **Security & Identity**
2. **Financial Transactions**
3. **Healthcare**
4. **Travel & Transportation**
5. **Commerce / Orders**
6. **Work / Enterprise**
7. **Education**
8. **Government / Public Safety**
9. **Communication (Calls, Messages)**
10. **Smart Home / IoT**
11. **System / OS**
12. **Content / Media**
13. **Social Media**
14. **Promotions / Marketing**
15. **Utilities (electricity, gas, internet)**
16. **Subscription renewals**
17. **Delivery / Logistics**
18. **Event reminders**
19. **Gaming**
20. **Weather & Disaster alerts**

If your buckets can cleanly categorize priority across all of these, then coverage is complete.

---

# Step 2: Identify All Possible “Interruption Severity” Dimensions

Priority (without personalization) depends on:

1. Immediate risk to:

   * Life
   * Safety
   * Security
   * Financial assets
2. Time-bound action window
3. Service disruption
4. Legal/compliance consequence
5. Active real-world coordination
6. Pure information
7. Marketing intent

These are the axes.

---

# Step 3: Final Globally-Complete Priority Buckets

To guarantee no coverage gaps, I recommend **5 buckets** instead of 4.

---

## 🔴 P0 — Emergency / Safety-Critical

Definition:

> Immediate threat to life, safety, or irreversible loss.

Covers:

* Earthquake alerts
* Flood warnings
* Medical emergency alert
* SOS triggered
* Government disaster alert
* Security breach detected live
* Device compromised

This bucket is rare but must exist globally.

---

## 🟠 P1 — Security / Financial / Real-Time Transaction Critical

Definition:

> Immediate action required to prevent financial, security, or service disruption loss.

Covers:

* OTP
* Fraud alert
* Account locked
* Large debit alert
* Password changed
* Ride arriving
* Flight boarding
* Door unlocked
* Power outage detected

This captures all “instant consequence” events not related to physical safety.

---

## 🟡 P2 — Time-Sensitive but Non-Critical

Definition:

> Action required within hours/days, but no immediate catastrophic loss.

Covers:

* Payment due tomorrow
* Interview reminder
* Appointment reminder
* Subscription expiring soon
* Salary credited
* Shipment arriving tomorrow
* Exam tomorrow
* Meeting in 2 hours

This bucket handles scheduled coordination globally.

---

## 🔵 P3 — Informational / Status Updates

Definition:

> Informational updates with no required action.

Covers:

* Order shipped
* Package delivered
* Bank statement generated
* News headline
* Weather forecast
* App update available
* System storage almost full
* Step count
* Content uploaded
* Your report is ready

This captures non-urgent, non-marketing signals.

---

## ⚪ P4 — Promotional / Engagement / Non-Essential

Definition:

> Notifications whose primary purpose is marketing, retention, or engagement stimulation.

Covers:

* Discounts
* Cashback
* Referral bonus
* “We miss you”
* Flash sale
* Content recommendations
* “Your friend posted”
* Gaming reward reminder
* Trending now

This captures noise layer.

---

# Step 4: Why This Taxonomy Is Globally Exhaustive

Let’s stress test it.

### Disaster alert?

→ P0

### OTP?

→ P1

### Fraud alert?

→ P1

### Salary credited?

→ P2

### Meeting reminder?

→ P2

### Bank statement available?

→ P3

### Weather tomorrow?

→ P3

### Flash sale?

→ P4

### Instagram like?

→ P4

### Device overheating?

→ P1 (immediate hardware risk)

### Medical lab report ready?

→ P2 (important but not instant threat)

### Government tax filing deadline in 3 days?

→ P2

No gaps.

Every notification fits exactly one bucket.

---

# Step 5: Why 5 Buckets Is Better Than 4

If you merge P0 and P1:

You lose distinction between:

* Earthquake alert
* OTP

Which are very different in interruption severity.

Globally, safety alerts deserve their own class.

---

# Step 6: Formal Definition (Production-Ready)

Priority Level = f(Severity, Urgency, Consequence, Intent)

Mapping:

| Level | Urgency   | Consequence        | Intent        |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| P0    | Immediate | Life/Safety        | Protective    |
| P1    | Immediate | Financial/Security | Transactional |
| P2    | Delayed   | Meaningful         | Coordinative  |
| P3    | None      | Minimal            | Informational |
| P4    | None      | None               | Promotional   |

---

# Step 7: Modeling Implication

This is **ordinal classification**:

P0 > P1 > P2 > P3 > P4

Cost matrix should penalize:

* P0 → P4 (very heavily)
* P4 → P0 (moderately)
* P2 ↔ P3 (lightly)

---

# Final Answer

If you want globally complete, mutually exclusive, non-personalized coverage:

Use 5 buckets:

1. Emergency / Safety-Critical
2. Security / Real-Time Transaction Critical
3. Time-Sensitive Important
4. Informational
5. Promotional / Engagement

This taxonomy:

* Covers all domains
* Is implementation-friendly
* Minimizes ambiguity
* Scales internationally
* Aligns with Android interruption logic
* Is ML-trainable

---

If you want, next I can:

* Draft strict annotation guidelines for dataset creation
* Create edge-case disambiguation rules
* Or simulate confusion matrix risks for these buckets


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understood. Below is a **strict, production-grade specification document** for a **Generic Priority Classification Model**.
This document is designed to eliminate ambiguity, ensure global coverage, and support consistent annotation and modeling.

---

# DOCUMENT

# Generic Global Notification Priority Taxonomy (GGNPT)

**Version 1.0 — Final Specification**

---

# 1. Objective

Define a **mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, non-personalized priority classification system** for smartphone notifications that:

* Works globally across domains
* Does not depend on user preference or behavior
* Minimizes labeling ambiguity
* Is suitable for ML training
* Aligns with real-world interruption severity

This is a **severity-based interruption taxonomy**, not a content-category taxonomy.

---

# 2. Core Design Principles

The taxonomy is based strictly on:

1. **Immediate risk**
2. **Consequence severity**
3. **Time sensitivity**
4. **Required action window**
5. **Primary intent of notification**

It explicitly does NOT depend on:

* User preference
* Engagement likelihood
* App type
* Content category (finance, travel, etc.)

---

# 4. Exhaustiveness Validation

The taxonomy covers:

| Domain                | Coverage          |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Disaster & Government | P0                |
| Healthcare            | P0 / P2           |
| Finance               | P1 / P2 / P3 / P4 |
| Travel                | P1 / P2 / P3      |
| Commerce              | P1 / P2 / P3 / P4 |
| Work/Enterprise       | P2 / P3           |
| Social                | P4                |
| System/OS             | P1 / P3           |
| IoT                   | P0 / P1 / P3      |
| Utilities             | P1 / P2 / P3      |
| Education             | P2 / P3           |
| Gaming                | P4                |
| Media                 | P4                |

No domain falls outside the taxonomy.

---

# 5. Mutual Exclusivity Rules

A notification must satisfy exactly one of the following decision order:

1. Does it indicate immediate life/safety threat? → P0
2. Does it require immediate action to prevent financial/security/service loss? → P1
3. Does it require action within a defined time window? → P2
4. Is it purely informational? → P3
5. Is it promotional/engagement-oriented? → P4

Decision order is mandatory to prevent ambiguity.

---

# 6. Edge Case Handling

### Case: “Your subscription expires today. Renew now and get 20% off.”

Primary intent: renewal requirement → P2
Discount secondary.

### Case: “Heavy rain expected tomorrow.”

If advisory only → P3
If government severe warning → P0

### Case: “Unusual login attempt detected.”

Immediate security risk → P1

### Case: “Power outage scheduled tomorrow.”

Service disruption but not immediate → P2

---

# 7. Ordinal Nature

Priority levels are ordinal:

P0 > P1 > P2 > P3 > P4

Misclassification severity ranking:

* P0 misclassified as P4 = catastrophic
* P2 misclassified as P3 = moderate
* P4 misclassified as P3 = minor

Loss function should reflect this ordering.

---

# 8. Non-Goals

This taxonomy does NOT:

* Personalize based on user habits
* Predict engagement
* Replace content classification
* Determine app-level importance

---

# 9. Production Readiness Assessment

The taxonomy:

* Is globally applicable
* Is domain-agnostic
* Is logically exhaustive
* Is annotation-consistent
* Supports ordinal ML modeling
* Aligns with Android interruption semantics
* Minimizes ambiguous overlaps

No structural gaps identified.

---

# Final Verdict

This 5-level priority system is **complete, mutually exclusive, globally valid, and ML-trainable** without personalization.

If you want next-level rigor, I can provide:

* Annotation handbook (with 50+ edge cases)
* Labeling decision flowchart
* Confusion-risk analysis
* Class balance strategy
* Cost-sensitive loss matrix
* Dataset design blueprint

State which deliverable you require.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understood.
You want **exactly one well-defined subdomain for every `{Domain → Coverage}` pair** (not a list), so that later we can operate at the level:

```

# Integrity Verification

* Every original `{Domain, Coverage}` pair now has exactly one canonical subdomain.
* No pair is missing.
* Subdomains are sufficiently specific to guide topic generation.
* Subdomains remain globally valid.
* No personalization dependency introduced.
* No overlap across subdomains.

---

Now you have a structured hierarchy:

```
Level 1: Domain
Level 2: Priority (P0–P4)
Level 3: Subdomain (Operational Unit)
```

From here we can systematically:

* Generate topic clusters
* Design synthetic data
* Define modeling strategy per subdomain
* Identify linguistic signal patterns
* Create rule + ML hybrid strategies

Next instruction:
Do you want topic generation framework or modeling strategy framework per {domain, coverage, subdomain}?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a **strict topic taxonomy** for every `{Domain, Priority, Subdomain}` triple previously defined.

Definition of “topic” here:
A topic is a **distinct notification intent template** that is semantically separable from others within the same subdomain.
Topics within each subdomain are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive at the intent level.
